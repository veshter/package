Migrating from VESHTER Network servers
======================================

As part of the migration process away from VESHTER Network, the company issues asset and source files which can be installed on any server that has the necessary prerequisite software. There is no installer or setup application; however, the installation process is fairly straight forward.

_Note:_ If you wish to simply host your web site somewhere but not have to setup the server and pre-requisite software, there are many inexpesive web hosting plans available on the Internet. For example, GoDaddy.

Required Software
-----------------

+ Modern LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) server.
+ Web hosting for two MySQL databases
+ [Google API license] (https://code.google.com/apis/console/)
